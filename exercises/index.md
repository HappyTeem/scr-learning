# Exercises
The following few pages will be exercises, in which you should write your solution in either C++, Python, or Java.

Some of the exercises will be the same as exercises in other languages, the only difference being that the solution to the particular problem you are solving is written in the language you have selected.

Make sure to read the question statement, input format, and output format. These are crucial to your understanding of the problem.

In some cases, when you don't completely understand a problem, read the sample input and output. Try seeing how the input lead to the output. This may help you understand the problem.

In order to simulate the USACO and AP CSA problem writing style, a precondition is also included. Our exercises will typically not require these, but it is good practice to read it.

Though these exercises are elementary compared to USACO problems, they foster neccessary problem solving skills, and also complement your learning of a programming language.

The key takeaway from these exercises is understanding how to read a problem. The exercises also helps you train your fundamental skills, which is crucial for you to succeed.

All of these exercises can be solved with skills that you have learned in the learning modules.

Remember to read the solution! Even if your solution is correct but different, it is a good idea to learn how other approached the problem. If you have a different solution that you believe is good, feel free to submit a pull request. All of our exercise pages have a link that allows you to edit that specific exercise page.

Sometimes we will have quiz-like questions. These questions will be answered through the terminal. For example, if a question asks what 1+1 is, you will print 2 into the terminal.
